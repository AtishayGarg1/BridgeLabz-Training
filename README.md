# 

# Understood the structure of C# programs, syntax rules, and the role of the Main() method.

# 

# 🛠️ Hands-on Practice

# 

# Solved simple logical programs to become familiar with console input and output.

# 

# 🗓️ Day 2: Core C# Language Basics

# 📌 Concepts Covered

# 

# Studied C# data types and their practical usage.

# 

# Learned various C# operators, including:

# 

# Arithmetic operators

# 

# Relational operators

# 

# Logical operators

# 

# Assignment operators

# 

# Unary operators

# 

# 🛠️ Hands-on Practice

# 

# Implemented basic C# programs using data types and operators.

# 

# Practiced expressions to understand operator precedence.

# 

# 🗓️ Day 3: C# Operators, Access Modifiers \& Practical Programming

# 📌 Concepts Covered

# 

# Worked with arithmetic operations such as:

# 

# Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus

# 

# Understood type conversion and casting between numeric data types.

# 

# Learned access modifiers in C#, including:

# 

# public

# 

# private

# 

# protected

# 

# internal

# 

# protected internal

# 

# private protected

# 

# Applied mathematical formulas and logical expressions in C# programs.

# 

# 🛠️ Hands-on Practice

# 

# Wrote console-based C# programs to practice:

# 

# Calculations and conversions

# 

# Access modifier usage

# 

# Swapping values

# 

# Basic logic-based problems

# 

# Used user input and output extensively.

# 

# 🗓️ Day 4: Control Flow Statements \& Iterative Programming

# 📌 Concepts Covered

# 

# Understanding decision-making statements in C#:

# 

# if, if-else, else-if ladder

# 

# switch statements

# 

# Introduction to looping constructs:

# 

# for loop

# 

# while loop

# 

# do-while loop

# 

# Usage of break and continue statements.

# 

# Logical flow control using conditions and loops.

# 

# 🛠️ Hands-on Practice

# 

# Implemented C# programs using:

# 

# Conditional logic for decision making

# 

# Loop-based problems such as counting, summation, and pattern-style logic

# 

# Practiced menu-driven console applications.

# 

# Strengthened understanding of iteration and program flow.

# 

# 🗓️ Day 5: Arrays \& Structured Data Handling

# 📌 Concepts Covered

# 

# Introduction to arrays in C# and their importance.

# 

# Declaration, initialization, and traversal of arrays.

# 

# Understanding single-dimensional arrays.

# 

# Performing operations on arrays such as:

# 

# Searching

# 

# Summation

# 

# Finding minimum and maximum values

# 

# Basics of working with user-defined data collections.

# 

# 🛠️ Hands-on Practice

# 

# Wrote C# programs to:

# 

# Store and process multiple values using arrays

# 

# Perform calculations on array elements

# 

# Display results using loops

# 

# Practiced real-world examples such as:

# 

# Salary calculations
